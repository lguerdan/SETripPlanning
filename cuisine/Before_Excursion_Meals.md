This restaurant is rated number one by TripAdvisor so obviously it's going to be a great place to check out when it comes to seeing what kind of breakfast Canadians enjoy on the go. The restaurant opens at 8am so we can come in quick before we start the days excursion at 10am.

This restaurant comes in second on TripAdvisior and looks alittle bit more fancy then our first one so we can plan on spending alittle bit more money this time. The quality of the food not only looks amazing, but also the menu is very unique. This is a Mediterinean Cafe and should be very interesting to try out. Going at 8am will make sure we are ready for whatever they day has instore for us.
