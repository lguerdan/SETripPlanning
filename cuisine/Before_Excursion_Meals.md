This restaurant is rated number one by TripAdvisor so obviously it's going to be a great place to check out when it comes to seeing what kind of breakfast Canadians enjoy on the go. The restaurant opens at 8am so we can come in quick before we start the days excursion at 10am.

This restaurant comes in second on TripAdvisior and looks alittle bit more fancy then our first one so we can plan on spending alittle bit more money this time. The quality of the food not only looks amazing, but also the menu is very unique. This is a Mediterinean Cafe and should be very interesting to try out. Going at 8am will make sure we are ready for whatever they day has instore for us.

Before our final day enjoying what Canada has to offer, I've decided we go to a cool Belgian Waffle Bar that is also ranked the number 4 breakfast joint on TripAdvisor. We have been spending alot of money on this trip so far so spending under 20 this time will be nice on everyones wallet and we will also get to enjoy such a sweet treat. Going at 8am will work with our schedule as usual.

Unfortunately this will be our last meal in Canada so lets make it a good one. Our flight is at 3:30pm and this highly regarded restaurant near the airport we are flying out of starts serving lunch at 11pm we could go there get ourself a nice large lunch and make our way to the airport.</p>
